This is a faithful recreation of the Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man arcade games reverse engineered in javascript.

In order to play, the files will have to be placed on a web server and loaded in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. *Safari does not work*

My goal in this project was to get as close to pixel perfect as possible. And I think it's fairly close, but there are some inconsistencies still. The game includes all credit/title scenes and cut scenes for both Pac-Man and Ms Pac-Man.
